### 2.5.3 Example: Symbolic Algebra



outline

[TOC]





What we will do is look at a simple but import part of algebraic manipulation:the arithmetic of polynomials.



#### Arithmetic on polynomials



$5x^2 + 3x + 7$ is a simple polynomial in x,

$(y^2 + 1)x^3 + (2y)x + 1$ is a polynomial in x whose coefficients are polynomials in y.

In our algebraic-manipulation system a "plynomial" will be aprticular syntactic fom, not tis underlying mathematical meaning.



poly

- constructor `make-poly`
- selector `variable` `term-list`



```lisp
(define (add-poly p1 p2)
  (if (same-variable? (variable p1) (variable p2))
      (make-poly (variable p1)
                 (add-terms (term-list p1)
                            (term-list p2)))
      (error "Polys not in same var -- ADD-POLY"
             (list p1 p2))))

(define (add-poly p1 p2)
  (if (same-variable? (variable p1) (variable p2))
      (make-poly (variable p1)
                 (mul-terms (term-list p1)
                            (term-list p2)))
      (error "Polys not in same var -- MUL-POLY"
             (list p1 p2))))

```



package

```lisp
(define (install-polynomial-package)
  ;; internal procedures
  ;; representation of poly
  (define (make-poly variable term-list)
    (cons variable term-list))
  (define (variable p) (car p))
  (define (term-list p) (cdr p))
  <procedures same-variable? and variable? from section 2.3.2>
  ;; repesentation of terms and term lists
  <procedures adjoin-term ...coeff from text below>
  ;; continued on next page
  
  (define (add-poly p1 p2) ...)
  (define (mul-poly p1 p2) ...)
  
  ;; interface to rest of the system
  (define (tag p) (attach-tag 'polynomialp))
  (put 'add '(polynomial polynomial)
       (lambda (p1 p2) (tag (add-poly p1 p2))))
  (put 'mul '(polynomial polynomial)
       (lambda (p1 p2) (tag (mul-poly p1 p2))))
  (put 'make 'polynomial
       (lambda (var terms) (tag (make-poly var terms))))
  'done)
```



manipulate terms

- the-empty-termlist
- empty-termlist?
- adjoin-term
- first-term
- rest-terms

```lisp
(define (add-terms L1 L2)
  (cond ((empty-termlist? L1) L2)
    ((empty-termlist? L2) L1)
    (else
     (let ((t1 (first-term L1))
           (t2 (first-term L2)))
          (cond ((> (order t1) (order t2))
                 (adjoin-term
                  t1 (add-terms (rest-terms L1) L2)))
            ((< (order t1) (order t2))
             (adjoin-term
              t2 (add-terms L1 (rest-term L2))))
            (else
             (adjoin-term
              (make-term (order t1)
                         (add (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
              (add-terms (rest-terms L1)
                         (rest-terms L2)))))))))

(define (mul-terms L1 L2)
  (if (empty-termlist? L1)
      (the-empty-termlist)
      (add-terms (mul-term-by-all-term (first-term L1) L2)
                 (mul-terms (rest-terms L1) L2))))

(define (mul-term-by-all-terms t1 L)
  (if (empty-termlist? L)
      (let ((t2 (fist-term L)))
           (adjoin-term
            (make-term (+ (order t1) (order t2))
                       (mul (coeff t2) (coeff t2)))
            (mul-term-by-all-terms t1 (rest-terms L))))))

```



#### Representing term lists



```lisp
(define (adjoin-term term term-list)
  (if (=zero? (coeff term))
      term-list
      (cons term term-list)))
(define (the-empty-termlist) '())
(define (fisrt-term term-list) (car term-list))
(define (rest-terms term-list) (cdr term-list))
(define (empty-termlist? term-list) (null? term-list))
(define (make-term order coeff) (list order coeff))
(define (order term) (car term))
(define (coeff term) (cadr term))

(define (make-polynomial var terms)
  ((get 'make 'polynomial) var terms))
```
