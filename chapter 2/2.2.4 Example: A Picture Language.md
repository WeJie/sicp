### 2.2.4 Example: A Picture Language

*outline*

[TOC]



This section presents a simple language for drawing pictures that illustrates the power of **data abstraction** and **closure**, and also exploits **higher-order procedures** in an essential way.



#### The picture language

In this language, the data objects being combined are represented as procedures rather than as list structure.

The fact hta apinters a closed under the language's means of combination. The beside or below of two painters is itself a painter; therefore, we can use it as in making more complex painters.



```lisp
(define wave2 (beside wave (flip-vert wave)))
(define wave4 (below wave2 wave2))

(define (flipped-pairs painter)
  (let ((painter2 (beside painter (flip-vert painter))))
       (below painter2 painter2)))
(define wave4 (flipped-pairs wave))

(define (right-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
           (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))

(define (corner-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((up (up-split painter (- n 1)))
            (right (right-split painter (- n 1))))
           (let ((top-left (beside up up))
                 (bottom-right (below right right))
                 (corner (corner-split painter (- n 1))))
                (beside (below painter top-left)
                        (below bottom-right corner))))))

(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((quarter (corner-split painter n)))
       (let ((half (beside (flip-horiz quarter) quarter)))
            (below (flip-vert half) half))))
```



##### Exercise 2.44 

```lisp
(define (up-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0))
  painter
  (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
       (below (beside smaller smaller) painter)))
```



#### Highter-order operations

```lisp
(define (square-of-four tl tr bl br)
  (lambda (painter)
          (let ((top (beside (tl painter) (tr painter)))
                (bottom (beside (bl painter) (br painter))))
               (below bottom top))))

(define (flipped-pairs painter)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four identity flip-vert
                                  identity flip-vert)))
       (combine4 painter)))

(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four flip-horiz identity
                                  rotate180 flip-vert)))
       (combine4 (conrner-split painter n))))
```



##### Exercise 2.45

```lisp
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))

(define (split proc1 proc2)
  (lambda (painter n)
            (if (= n 0))
          painter
          (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
               (proc1 (proc2 smaller smaller) painter)))
  
```



#### Frames

A frame can be described by three [vectors](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vector_space) â€” an origin vector and two edge vectors. The origin vector specifies the offset of the frame's origin from some absolute origin in the plane, and the edge vectors specify the offsets of the frame's corners from its origin. 

```lisp
(define (frame-coord-map frame)
  (lambda (v)
          (add-vect (origin-frame frame)
                    (add-vect (scale-vect (xcor-vect v)
                                          (edge1-frame frame))
                              (scale-vect (ycor-vect v)
                                          (edge2-frame frame))))))
```



##### Exercise 2.46

$$
(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)
$$

$$
(x_1,  y_1) - (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2)
$$

$$
s \cdot (x, y) = (sx, sy)
$$

```lisp
(define (make-vect x-coordinate y-coordinate)
  (cons x-coordinate y-coordinate))

(define (xcor-vect vector)
  (car vector))

(define (ycor-vect vector)
  (cdr vector))

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
  (cons (+ (xcor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))
        (+ (xcor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
  (cons (- (xcor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))
        (- (xcor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale-vect vector s)
  (cons (* (xcor-vect vector) s) (* (ycor-vect vector) s)))
```



##### Exercise 2.47

```lisp
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))

(define (oirgin-frame frame)
  (car frame))

(define (edge1-frame frame)
  (car (cdr frame)))

(define (edge2-fram frame)
  (car (cdr (cdr frame))))
```

```lisp
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))

(define (origin-frame frame)
  (car frame))

(define (edge1-frame frame)
  (car (cdr frame)))

(define (edge2-frame frame)
  (cdr (cdr frame)))
```



#### Painters

```lisp
(define (segments->painter segment-list)
  (lambda (frame)
          (for-each
           (lambda (segment)
                   (draw-line
                    ((frame-coord-map frame) (start-segment segment))
                    ((frame-coord-map frame) (end-segment segment))))
           segment-list)))
```



##### Exercise 2.48

A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of vectors â€” the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of segment.

```lisp
(define (make-vect x-coordinate y-coordinate)
  (cons x-coordinate y-coordinate))

(define (xcor-vect vector)
  (car vector))

(define (ycor-vect vector)
  (cdr vector))

(define (make-segment start-vect end-vect)
  (cons start-vect end-vect))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cdr segment))

(make-segment (make-vect 1 1) (make-vect 2 2))
```



##### Exercise 2.49

```lisp
(define origin (make-vect 0 0))

(define y-vect (make-vect 1 0))

(define designated-frame (make-frame (origin x-vect y-vect)))

  (lambda (frame)

                    (painter
                     (make-frame new-origin

#### Levels of language for robust design

This is the aproach of  **stratified design**, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of language

Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level.

The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, mean of combination, and mean of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.
