### 3.1.2 The Benefits of Introducing Assignment



Viewing systems as collections of objects with local state is a powerful technique for maintaining a modular design.

```lisp
(define rand
  (let ((x random-init))
       (lambda ()
               (set! x (rand-update x))
               x)))
```



[The Monte Carlo Method](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monte_Carlo_method)

```lisp
(define (estimate-pi trials)
  (sqrt (/ 6 (monte-carlo trials cesaro-test))))

(define (cesaro-test)
  (= (gcd (rand) (rand)) 1))

(define (monte-carlo trials experiment)
  (define (iter trials-remaining trials-passed)
    (cond ((= trials-remaining 0)
           (/ trials-passed trials))
      ((experiment)
       (iter (- trials-remaining 1) (+ trials-passed 1)))
      (else
       (iter (- trials-remaining 1) trials-passed))))
  (iter trials 0))
```



使用 rand-update 代替 rand，无法对 model local state 使用 assignment

```lisp
(define (estimate-pi trials)
  (sqrt (/ 6 (random-gcd-test trials random-init))))

(define (random-gcd-test trials initial-x)
  (define (iter trials-remaining trials-passed x)
    (let ((x1 (rand-update x)))
         (let ((x2 (rand-update x1)))
              (cond 
                ((= trials-remaining 0) 
                 (/ trials-passed trials))
                ((= (gcd x1 x2) 1)
                 (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                       (+ trials-passed 1)
                       x2))
                (else
                 (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                       trials-passed x2))))))
  (iter trials 0 initial-x))
```

|                                   | 没有为随机数生成器提供本地状态，必须自己维护 x1、x2 并将 x2 作为 rand-update 的输入进行迭代 |
|                                   | 限制了 experiment 只能使用两个参数                  |
|                                   | 最顶层的 estimate-pi 还需要关心 random-init 的值    |
| 可以将 monte-carlo 应用于不同的 experiment | 随机数生成器的内部实现混入在程序中，导致 mote-carlo 难以独立出来为其他任务服务 |
| assignment 将随机数生成器的状态封装到 rand 中   |                                          |



Assignment and the technique of hiding state in local variables, we are able to structure systems in a more modular fashion than if all state had to be manipulated explicitly, by passing additional parameters.



##### Exercise 3.5

```lisp
(define (random-in-range how high)
  (let ((range (- high low)))
       (+ low (andom range))))
```



```lisp
(define (estimate-integral p rectg))
```

### 3.1.3 The Costs of Introducing Assignment



Programing without any use of assignments, as we did throughout the first two chapters of this book, is accordingly known as functional programming.



```lisp
(define (make-simplified-withdraw balance)
  (lambda (amount)
          (set! balance (- balance amount))
          balance))
(define W (make-simplified-withdraw 25))

(W 20)
5
(W 10)
-5
```



```lisp
(define (make-decrementer balance)
  (lambda (amount)
          (- balance amount)))

(define D (make-decrementer 25))
(D 20)
5
(D 10)
15
```



The trouble here is that substitution is based ultimately on the notion that the symbols in our language are essentially names for values. 

But  as soon as we introduce `set!` and the idea that the value of a variable can change, a variable somehow refers to a place where a value can be stored, and the value stored at this place can change.



#### Sameness and change

```lisp
(define D1 (make-decrementer 25))
(define D2 (make-decrementer 25))

(define W1 (make-simplified-withdraw 25))
(define W2 (make-simplified-withdraw 25))
```



A language that supports the concept that "equals can be substituted for equals" in an expression without changing the value of the expression is said to be referentially transparent.



How can we tell if an object has "changed" other than by observing the "same" object twice and seeing whether some property of the object differs from one observation to the next? 

Thus, we cannot detemine "change" without some a priori notion of "sameness," and we cannot determine sameness without observing the effects of change. 

```lisp
(define peter-acc (make-account 100))
(define paul-acc (make-account 100))

;; difference modeling
(define peter-acc (make-account 100))
(define paul-acc peter-acc)
```





#### Pitfalls of imperative programming 命令式编程的潜在风险



In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes extensive user of assignment is known as imperative programming.



```lisp
(define (factorial n)
  (define (iter product counter)
    (if (> counter n)
        product
        (iter (* counter product)
              (+ counter 1))))
  (iter 1 1))
```

imperative style

```lisp
(define (factorial n)
  (let ((product 1)
        (counter 1))
       (define (iter)
         (if (> counter n)
             product 
             (begin (set! product (* counter product))
                    (set! counter (+ counter 1))
                    (iter))))
       (iter)))
```

        "Insufficient funds"))

    (set! balance (+ balance amount))

          ((eq? m 'withdraw) (acc password 'withdraw))
          ((eq? m 'deposit)  (acc password 'deposit))
          (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-JOINT" m))))
  dispatch)
